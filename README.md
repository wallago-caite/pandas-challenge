# 'PYCITY SCHOOLS ANALYSIS'


## Summary of Analysis
    The analysis compares reading and math test scores for about 39,000 students in a district with 15 schools.  
    Then we compare those test scores across various metrics, including grade level, school spending, school type,budget, and size of each school.
    Excel results are located in the repository under "summary.xlsx"

## Conclusions
    Charter vs District School Performance
        -Counterintuitively, charter schools far outperform district schools in all test metric -- reading, math, and overall passing percentages.  
        -Despite this, charter schools are both the top 5 performing schools and the bottom 5 performing schools. 
        -Because charter performance is fairly variable, it is likely that segregating charter and district school performances will give clearer insights for decision-makers. 

    Budgets
        -Also counterintuitively, schools with lower per-student budgets outperform those with higher per-student budget. 
        -One concern about the analysis however, is that we have not taken into account the outliers like Bailey High, with huge budgets and terrible test scores.  Without understanding a bit more about these outliers, we can't take well-informed action.
