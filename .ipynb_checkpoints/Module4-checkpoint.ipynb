    "## Summary of Analysis\n",
    "    The analysis compares reading and math test scores for about 39,000 students in a district with 15 schools.  \n",
    "    Then we compare those test scores across various metrics, including grade level, school spending, school type,budget, and size of each school.\n",
    "    Excel results are located in the repository under \"summary.xlsx\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "    Charter vs District School Performance\n",
    "        -Counterintuitively, charter schools far outperform district schools in all test metric -- reading, math, and overall passing percentages.  \n",
    "        -Despite this, charter schools are both the top 5 performing schools and the bottom 5 performing schools. \n",
    "        -Because charter performance is fairly variable, it is likely that segregating charter and district school performances will give clearer insights for decision-makers. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Budgets\n",
    "        -Also counterintuitively, schools with lower per-student budgets outperform those with higher per-student budget. \n",
    "        -One concern about the analysis however, is that we have not taken into account the outliers like Bailey High, with huge budgets and terrible test scores.  Without understanding a bit more about these outliers, we can't take well-informed action.  \n"
